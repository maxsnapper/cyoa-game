My attempt into learning to code in Python, with a "Choose your own adventure" game program.

This has influence taken from Nethack, and choose your own adventure game books, this is only a learning exercise. 

Constructive criticsm welcomed, as this is primarily to improve my knowledge, including any style changes. Please bear in mind this is a work in progress.
